Here's some code I've been using to benchmark RabbitMQ recently.

Usage
=====

Create a config.txt file, like this, in the same directory as this README:

  host = hostname of your rabbitmq server
  port = 5672
  user = your rabbitmq username
  password = your rabbitmq password
  exchange = tempexch
  queue = tempqueue
  durable = true
  ssl = false

Then try running some of the Python scripts.

Change the 'durable' line to 'durable = 0'
